# Area
This is a program that calculates the <b> area, surface area, and volume of various geometric shapes.</b> It has functions defined for calculating the area of a square, triangle, and rectangle </b>; the surface area of a cube and cuboid; and the volume of a cube and cuboid.

The main function prompts the user to enter the name of a shape and then calls the appropriate function to calculate the area, surface area, or volume of that shape. If the user enters an invalid shape name, the program will print an error message.

The program uses the input function to get user input and the float function to convert the user input to a floating-point number. It also uses the print function to output the results of the calculations.
